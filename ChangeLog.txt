ChangeLog for Auction House DataBase (AHDB) by MooreaTv (moorea@ymail.com)

Coming next:
- Your input/suggestions welcome !
- See open issues for ideas https://github.com/mooreatv/AuctionDB/issues)

v0.11.05 Aug 29th 2019
- 
v0.11.04 Aug 28th 2019
- Fixed minimap button and big button drag to move forgetting location on reload (thx Bayart for the report!)
v0.11.03 Aug 28th 2019
- Fix bogus "Can't scan outside of cities..."
v0.11.02 Aug 28th 2019
- Software is hard... Really fixed #12, #13, #14 now. Should not show button unless rested and should
  not spam the chat periodically either
v0.11.01 Aug 28th 2019
- Opsa... was still starting with button shown irrespective of resting state (!) - sorry - fixed now!
v0.11.00 Aug 27th 2019
- No more pause/hang on classic at the end of the first scan!
- Unlike in BfA which doesn't mind despite 100x more items, for classic we needed to not restore 
  the item update event immediately, yet keep the UI functional even if you search after 
  and hit enter in Name editbox for instance (still haven't found how to hide previous results
  if you manual search first and then do a full scan but it's only cosmetically wrong in that case)
- Fix the inital /tar -> /scan button binding
- Detect "in combat" overlapping with start/end of resting to avoid addon blocked errors

v0.10.00 Aug 27th 2019
- Don't show the big pulsating button unless IsResting() (ie in city/inns) - Fixing Issue #12
- Don't bind key for full scan unless at AH
- Option to turn off the /tar auctioneer binding
- Now works even if another addon (like aux-addon) hides the standard UI (moved ah open/close events to MoLib)
- Also from MoLib: Bug fixes on normally shrinking auctions list 
  (in classic unlike BfA it seems the list refreshes faster despite having fewer auctions)

v0.09.02 Aug 26th 2019
- Pick up another MoLib small fix (round to .1 copper when dividing (avoids 16.6666666 copper), 
  coding error in 1 of the warnings)
v0.09.01 Aug 26th 2019
- Pick up MoLib fix with typo in classic code path that couldn't be tested until now (!) sorry!
v0.09.00 Aug 26th 2019
- Rebranded from short name "AuctionDB" to "AHDB" to avoid confusion with TSM's internal module of the same name
- Now include current bid in scan DB v6 and deserialization on load.
- (for now) Requires Better Vendor Price to display AH results information through tooltip
- Classic is today !

v0.08.00 Aug 25th 2019
- Pickup from MoLib: itemdb version 4 (20% shorter), and a bug fix for suffixid
- Better/more Localization strings

v0.07.01 Aug 24th 2019
(from MoLib)
- Fixed bogus realm mismatch warning
v0.07.00 Aug 23rd 2019
(from MoLib:)
- New ItemDB even more compact format 
- Scan data also better structure: group by item and seller, 
  now down to 1.5Mb a scan from 30Mb when I started.

v0.06.00 Aug 23rd 2019
- Pick up big AH changes in MoLib - https://github.com/mooreatv/MoLib/blob/master/ChangeLog.txt
- Also bind IWT (so hitting it 3 times starts a scan (target, open, start scan))
- New transparent, glowing button
- Added shift key to prevent auto scan feature (auto scan delay is noop atm)

v0.05.00 Aug 22nd 2019
- The build now includes localization
- bug fix: use PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED as the event to hide our button, avoids combat error
  (thanks humfras!)
v0.04.00 Aug 22nd 2019
- Now with functional auto scan as well as secure button to target, scan and reload
- options panel controls how many newly found items should be shown in each scan
v0.03.00 Aug 21st 2019
- Pick up MoLib changes to split item DB and scan results yielding 30Mb -> 2Mb decrease
 (+ couple Mb for itemDB but that's fixed cost with number of scans)
v0.02.01 Aug 20th 2019
- Initial functional version, click to scan
v0.01.01 August 20th 2019
- AH context call and key bindings (and pick up newer MoLib)
v0.01.00 August 19th 2019
- Options/config pane
- initial version, created from MooreaTv/WowAddonTemplate
./newaddon.sh 'AuctionDB' 'ADB' 'Auction House DataBase' 'AUCTIONDB' 'ahdb' 'Auction House DataBase, records DB history and offline queries, for classic and more'
